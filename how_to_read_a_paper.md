# How to Read a Paper
## Abstract
<p>Researchers spend a great deal of time reading research papers. However, this skill is rarely taught, leading to much
wasted effort. This article outlines a practical and efficient three-pass method for reading research papers.</p>

## Introduction
**Researchers must read papers** for several reasons: to review them for a **conference** or a class, to keep current in their field, or for a literature survey of a new field. A typical researcher will likely spend hundreds of hours every year reading papers.

Learning to efficiently read a paper is a critical but rarely taught skill. Beginning graduate students, therefore, must learn on their own using trial and error. Students waste much effort in the process and are frequently driven to frustration.

For many years I have used **a simple approach** to efficiently read papers. This paper describes the **‘three-pass’ approach** and its use in doing a literature survey.

## The three-pass approach
The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to **three passes**, instead of starting at the beginning and plowing your way to the end. **Each pass accomplishes specific goals** and builds upon the previous pass: The *first pass gives you a general idea about the paper*. *The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content*, but not its details. *The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.*
### The first pass
The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird's eye view of the paper. You can decide whether you need to do any more passes. This pass shoud take about 5 to 10 minutes and consists of the following steps:

1. Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
2. Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else.
3. Read the conclusion.
4. Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read.
   
At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the five questions:

1. **Category:** What type of paper is this? A measurement paper? An analysis of an existing system? A
description of a research prototype?
2. **Context:** Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
3. **Correctness:** Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
4. **Contributions:** What are the paper’s main contributions?
5. **Clarity:** Is the paper well written?

Using this information, you may **choose not to read further**. This could be because the paper doesn’t interest you, or you don’t know enough about the area to understand the paper, or that the authors **make invalid assumptions**. The first pass is adequate for papers that aren’t in your research area, but may someday prove relevant.

Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the highlights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

### The second pass
In the second pass, read the paper with **greater care**, but **ignore details such as proofs**. It helps to jot down the **key points**, or to make comments in the margins, as you read.

1. Look carefully at the **figures, diagrams and other illustrations** in the paper. Pay special attention to **graphs**. Are the **axes** properly **labeled**? Are results shown with error bars, so that **conclusions are statistically significant**? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.
2. Remember to **mark relevant unread references** for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).

The second pass should take up to **an hour**. After this pass, you should be able to **grasp the content of the paper**.
You should be able to **summarize the main thrust of the paper**, with supporting evidence, to someone else. This level of
detail is appropriate for a paper in which you are interested, but does not lie in your research speciality.

**Sometimes you won’t understand a paper** even at the **end of the second pass**. This may be **because** the subject matter
is **new to you**, with unfamiliar terminology and acronyms. Or the authors may use a proof or experimental technique
that you don’t understand, so that the bulk of the paper is incomprehensible. The paper may be poorly written
with unsubstantiated assertions and numerous forward references. Or it could just be that it’s late at night and you’re
tired. You can now choose to: **(a) set the paper aside**, hoping you don’t need to understand the material to be successful
in your career, **(b) return to the paper later**, perhaps after reading background material or **(c) persevere and go on to the third pass.**

### The third pass

To fully understand a paper, particularly if you are reviewer, requires a third pass. **The key** to the third pass
is to **attempt to virtually re-implement** the paper: that is,
making the same assumptions as the authors, **re-create the work**. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper,
you can easily identify not only a paper’s innovations, but
also its hidden failings and assumptions.

This pass requires **great attention to detail**. You should
identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.
Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would
present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual
with the virtual **lends a sharp insight** into the proof and
presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely
add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you
should also jot down ideas for future work.

This pass can take about **four or five hours for beginners**,
and about an hour for an **experienced reader**. At the end
of this pass, you should be able to **reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory**, as well as be able to
identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should
be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations
to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or
analytical techniques.
